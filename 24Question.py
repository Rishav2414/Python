# Q1: addition_str is a string with a list of numbers separated by the + sign. Write code that uses the accumulation 
# pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to sum_val (an integer). 
# (You should use the .split("+") function to split by "+" and int() to cast to an integer).

# Q2: week_temps_f is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the , sign. 
# Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average (sum divided by number of items) 
# and assigns it to avg_temp. Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or 
# the number of items in week_temps_f) (You should use the .split(",") function to split by "," and float() to cast to a float).

# Q3: Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the variable nums. Do not hard code the list.

nums = list(range(68))

# Q4: Write code to create a list of word lengths for the words in original_str using the accumulation pattern and 
# assign the answer to a variable num_words_list. (You should use the len function).

original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox"

num_words_list = []

for word in original_str.split():  
    num_words_list.append(len(word))

# Q6: Create an empty string and assign it to the variable lett. 
# Then using range, write code such that when your code is run, lett has 7 bâ€™s ("bbbbbbb").
