#Debugging
#----------
#syntax error:  The code is not correctly written according to Python’s rules, and the interpreter can’t run it.
#example: print("hello world"  --> indicate syntax error

#Runtime error: written correctly (no syntax errors), but something goes wrong during execution.
#example: print(3/0) -> is not legal operation
# subtotal = input("Enter total before tax:")
# tax = .08 * subTotal --> runtime error because sumTotal is not defined
# print("tax on", subtotal, "is:", tax)

#Sementic error: occurs when your code runs without errors, but it doesn’t do what you intended
#example: print("half percentage ", 1/2) -> it will print half percentage 0.5
